Welcome to my first Minecraft modding project! This mod is a collection of experimental features I'm testing as I dive into Minecraft mod development. It includes a variety of new content such as ores, materials, tools, armor, and miscellaneous items. You'll also find custom weapons, mobs, food, crops, plants, fluids, trees, and more. The code is a work in progress and may not be the prettiest, but it's all part of my learning journey. Expect frequent updates as I continue to explore and expand on new ideas!

For the most part I'm following the "Fabric Modding for Minecraft 1.21.X" course by Kaupenjoe.

- New Building Blocks

- Different Tools

- New Blocks with unique interactions

- New Tools, Weapons & Armor
